Here, you'll find help with the following scenarios

    We have this ticket, but don't know where to start on it.
    We've finished our ticket, now we don't know what to do next
    We're finding pairing difficult in our team
    We're not sure we're learning much without a tutorial
    What should we test in a Rails app?
    I've spent two days working on a problem, and I'm still blocked!

We have this ticket, but we don't know where to start on it

https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-rails-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

    Spend some time investigating how to approach it.
    List out the things that need to be done, try to list them out in as small a piece as possible
    Prioritise them:
        do some things have to be completed before others can be worked on?
        can some things be not-done/are unnecessary?
    Create individual tickets for all of them, and put them in the right list.
    Choose the smallest and easiest ticket first

We've finished our ticket, now we don't know what to do next

https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-rails-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

    In the Unestimated list, split a big ticket into smaller tickets if needed.
    Estimate how long the tickets will take
    Move them to To Do list once estimated
    Choose a ticket to work on from To Do and move to In Progress
    Complete Ticket
    Move it to Review
    Check with team for review (what is your review process?)
    Merge to the main branch if needed
    Move to Done
    Repeat from 3. Or from 1 if none are left

We're finding pairing difficult in our team

    honest communication is a skill everyone can improve on
    normalise giving feedback
        when you pair share feedback often, at least twice a day
            morning and afternoon, or after every feature
        facilitate a feedback session in every retrospective
            first theme can be about pairing expectations
    set timers for role switching, and timers for pairing sessions.
        1 hour pairing in 15 min sessions before switching roles.

We're not sure we're learning much without a tutorial

    Focus on giving yourself a clear objective and a way to test that you've achieved it, e.g.:
        Objective: I can follow the flow of data in a request/response cycle
            Test: diagram the flow of data using boxes and arrows for a process like going to the homepage/submitting a form
        Objective: I can do some rails by myself
            Test: build a small rails app without a tutorial
        Objective: I understand how HTTP requests map to Rails routes
            Test: Explain to someone how config/routes.rb relates to controllers

    take notes on your understanding

    explain your learning to someone else

    Keep doing and playing as much as you can without a tutorial

What should we test in a Rails app?

    Test the code that you write, not the code already written for you.
    Rails is opinionated. One of its opinions is about the kinds of tests you need to write.

        Comprehensive unit and feature tests are an accepted way to test a rails web application https://medium.com/table-xi/whats-up-with-rails-controller-tests-f0ece1fdd9f0

        Because feature tests are slow to run, depending on the size of the application, and the number of edge cases for a user's journey you can have a look at testing in more detail: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications

I've spent two days working on a problem, and I'm still blocked!

    Break your problem down into steps. For each step:
        do you need more information?
        do you need a specific kind of information?
        from who or where can you get that information?
    Improve your problem solving process
        keep escalating the problem until you find the right unblocker: use the coaches to help you!
