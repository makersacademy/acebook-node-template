# **Acebook Betta - Final Engineering Project**
Acebook aims to be an easy-to-use and accessible platform that simplifies staying in touch with friends.  
Acebook will connect people and make their lives betta.

## **Motivation and Purpose**
  
  An opportunity to work alongside a team to build an engineering project as part of the bootcamp and get close to real-life exposure to agile working practice.  
  Also an opportunity to use all of the skills that we learned so far in bootcamp.

## **Outcome** 

  Over the 2 weeks of development we not only built a project and repository,  
  but used and learnt about a very large variety of tools and working practices, including standups, agile,  
  teamwork, sprints, retro's and conflict resolution, version-control, bug reporting, CI pipelines,  
  Trello boards, planning and execution, Unit and Integration testing, end-to-end testing, hosting,  
  working with an existing codebase, new languages, picking up new tools quickly, dividing up labor and tasks,  
  time management, strong communication practices, including messaging through slack and frequent meetings,  
  and most importantly working with a multi-discplinary team.
  
  In terms of the final product, we built and hosted live an MVP of the project as initially concieved in early planning stages,  
  as well as a variety of planning documents and test reports.  
  Our final version of the project encompassed all functionality that we initially aimed to have developed by the end of the timeframe,  
  although we had a large amount of 'Nice to Have' functions that were in the timeline.
