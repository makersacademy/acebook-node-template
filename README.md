# Acebook 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/edmond-b/acebook-NO-de-Problem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/edmond-b/acebook-NO-de-Problem)

Acebook the best thing since facebook! This is a re-creation of classic facebook in Node.js using Express and React. The application is structured using modern RESTful route design with asynchronous fetch API calls from a frontend react controller to a backend express server which returns data using JSON.

## Features:

- Account creation
- Personalised profile image upload
- Post your most intimate thoughts to the global Acebook newsfeed
- Leave comments on posts
- Leave the site whenever you want with our `Log Out` button.

## Tech Stack:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for file uploads to the server.
- [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for password encryption.
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration and build testing.
- [React](https://reactjs.org) as a front end controller. 

## Development Process

Our team used an agile development process with periodic sprints to deliver Acebook to our client with regular check ins and feature updates. The client's specification was broken down by our team into user stories which were then assigned to team member pairs. This process allowed us to integrate changes in specification late into development and keep the team running by dividing up dividing up tasks during the sprints. We used a process of branches, pull-request code reviews and continuous integration testing pipelines to keep our code clean and dependendable.

For an insight into our agile process you can view our team's [card wall here](https://trello.com/b/fjC2EoVt/no-de-problem).

We employed extensive domain and database modelling for our application before beginning development as well as diagramming the flow of the application. There are links to our wiki with this planning below:

## Next Steps

While we were successful in delivering our `MVP` we also developed a number of further user stories in collaboration with our client which we were unable to complete during the project's current life cycle. We plan to tackle some of these further users stories at a later date.

## Testing

### Test Server

The test server must be running for integrationt tests to pass.
The test server runs on port `3030` at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

- Start test server on **Mac**:
  ```
  npm run start:test
  ```

- Start test server on **PC**:
  ```
  npm run start:pc
  ```

### Run Tests

- Run all tests:
    ```
    npm test
    ```

- Run `jest` unit tests:
    ```
    npm run test:unit
    ```
- Run `cypress` integration tests:
    ```
    npm run test:integration
    ```

## Learning

We ran daily retros to review each other's code and clarified our learning with a wiki post detailing the new knowledge we had acquired. You can a link to an overview of [daily learning here](https://github.com/edmond-b/acebook-NO-de-Problem/wiki/Daily-Learning).
