# Hi!
Here you will find anything from the QE team that
is worth checking from time to time. 
We will update this in-line with the project.

## Wireframes

We thought it was useful to build upon the wireframe from a QE perspective. These can be found on our Figma page here: 
[TeamFunk Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/qoltHqedBLzVWs1RozvMK6/Team_Funk_Page_Nav_QE?node-id=0%3A1&t=WbmmjJiXHF7fku98-1) 

This is a useful tool in getting a feel for how the site can be navigated.

## Github Actions / Tests Integration

We were able to implement Cypress and Jest tests to run with Github actions upon pushing code to the repo.
When you push code to the repo, click on the ['Actions'](https://github.com/codermacleod/teamFunk/actions) tab to see which tests are being carried out in real time.
