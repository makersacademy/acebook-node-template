# Exploratory Testing Notes

## Landing Page

## Sign-up Page

- Validation - should numbers be allowed in first name and second name? I believe it's standard to disallow the use of number
- Validation - Should the names be allowed with any capitalization and then be manipulated to always follow capital first letter structure?
- Validation - Check database for duplicate emails
- Feature suggestion - After signing up successfully, an alert pops up after the redirect to the login page that lets the user know their account was created successfully
- HTML - Consistency with element tagging - Title has a class on home page but not on sign up

## Single Post

- Validation on commenting - Currently can submit empty comment
- Feature Recommendation - User can remove their like from a post

### CSS

- Fixed size for the comment text box?

## Profile

- BUG - Name coming through as 'Name' instead of user name
