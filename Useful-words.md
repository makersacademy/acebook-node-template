This is a web framework for nodejs which is listed as a dependency in the packages.json file. We define the variable app as an express object in line 10 of app.js. The functions that are called on the app object will then, most likely be express methods or variables (but double check).

express: {
  set method - just assigning values to things
  use method - performs the code whenever a request is received. .use('/', etc.) performs etc when a request is received by '/', if there is no path (.use(etc)) the code is performed everytime a request is received.
}
