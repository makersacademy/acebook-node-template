Adding likes
============

What is a like? A like is a way of showing appreciation for a post. This can be your own post or others. It forms a sense of community.


As a user,
So I can express my appreciation for a post,
I'd like to be able to like a post.

# Simplest implementation (V1)

- a button that, when clicked, causes a counter to increment
- the button and the counter are displayed on the page next to the relevent post
- anybody can like a post as may times as they like
- the overall display will simply show how many likes a post has received

# Goal (V?)

- a like image button that, when clicked, causes a counter to increment
- the button and the counter are displayed on the page next to the relevent post
- only users can like posts
- each posts can only be liked once per user
- the overall display will show the total number of likes on a post + the names of up to the first two people who liked it
