Adding comments
============

What is a comment? A comment is a way of sharing your views on someone's post. This can be your own post or others. It forms a sense of community.


As a user,
So I can engage with a post,
I'd like to be able to comment on posts.

# Simplest implementation (V1)

- a text box to enter comment text. When clicked it displays the comment next to the original post.
- the text box and button are displayed on the page next to the relevent post
- anybody can like a comment as may times as they like
- all comments will be shown on the page

# Super stretch goal (V?)

- a button or link that would reveal a text box for entering a comment
- the link or button would be displayed under the original post
- the comment will display the author's name and the time posted
- other users can like comments (following current version's like rules)
- only users can comment on posts
- the number of comments by user on each post will be unlimited
- comments will be displayed with oldest first (default order)
- there will be a comment counter and user will have to click a button to show comments
